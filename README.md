# About
I made this installer based on an older github repo I had made a while ago, as a way for people to install libresprite as a windows isntaller instead of having to download the zip and deal with a bunch of confusing files. 

I will be continuing to update this script each time a new version of libresprite releases

# How to Use:
If you don't want to go through all the trouble of compiling the script yourself, I will provide a pre-compiled executable in the releases tab. 

If you want to compile this script yourself, you need the libresprite zip, and the .iss script in this repo. 

download Inno Setup Compiler, import the script using file -> open, edit the paths to point to the extracted libresprite 1.1 zip's paths. currently, I'm trying to figure out a way to make this universally compilable, but until then, compiling the script is a little difficult. 

# Special Thanks
Special Thanks to the LibreSprite Discord for giving me the idea to recreate this script
